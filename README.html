This virtual machine will allow you to test the <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a> <a href="https://github.com/trezor/connect" target="new">trezor connect</a> integration.

If you do not have the bindfs, cachier, and hostmanager vagrant plugins, you can install them with the following commands:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-bindfs
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

Next, provision the vagrant instance:

vagrant up

If the vagrant-hostmanager plugin fails, you may have to manually add the /etc/hosts entry:

## vagrant-hostmanager-start id: 9a3698f5-93f6-4fde-a941-9f5581f6a3e6
192.168.56.101	tc.dev tc.dev *.tc.dev
## vagrant-hostmanager-end

Listed below are the access credentials for the configured vm:

<h2>Testing Instructions</h2>

In order to test the integration, you will first need to associate your trezor device with an account.

This can be done two ways depending upon if you have an existing account:

<h3>1. User Registration</h3>

Click the <a href="http://tc.dev/user/register">Create new account</a> link, or visit <a href="http://tc.dev/user/register">http://tc.dev/user/register</a>.

Click the Sign in with TREZOR link and complete the trezor connect authentication process.

The authentication process performs an AJAX callback to store the authenticated details against your session.

Next, complete the registration process to create your new user account and your trezor device will be linked to your new account.

<h3>2. My Account > Authenticated Devices</h3>

You can login to an existing account, and click the My Account link to view your profile page.

Click the Authenticated Devices tab

Click the Sign in with TREZOR link and complete the trezor connect authentication process to link your trezor device to your new account.

To unlink a trezor device from your account, click the Forget Authentication Device button on the Authenticated Devices page.
